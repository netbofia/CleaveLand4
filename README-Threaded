Readme for threaded version.

What this is:
This is a wrapper for Cleaveland 4

The main objective of this process is to spead up the process of target prediction with cleaveland.

The implementation is perfectly scalable as long as you have the necessary RAM to allocated the transcriptome "N" times into memory.

The paralazation is done by. Splitting the sRNA fasta file into smaller portions. Say 10 sequences per thread. Cleaveland is run "N" times in separate subdirectories.
Once a process is finished the wrapper grabs the next 10 sequences in the original sRNA fasta file.

The number of sequences to be processed by each thread is customizable.

Once the whole fasta file has been parsed the program builds a unique output 

Dependencies
============

Must have the extract_x_seqs.sh in your path. It comes with this release (See Fasta_extractor)
Set up the location of Cleaveland4.pl (should be solved soon to relegate to path as well)
So far all I can remember.
